# RivetHoleFinder

## Description:
#### This repository contains a riveting hole finder that is generally more accurate than OpenCV's HoughCircles method. I created these files so that one of my coworkers at the BARC could use it on a camera attached to the robotic drilling arm. You can test the algorithm using the app.py as the main run file and the circle_detected.jpg image as the test image. See app.py, CircleManager.py for more details on how the code works.

#### These files are subject to change to improve efficiency of the runtime.
